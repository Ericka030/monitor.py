# monitor.py
Overview: This code monitors multiple websites by performing HTTP requests to check their status. It establishes TCP connections to given URLs, sends HTTP GET requests, and analyzes the responses. If the response indicates a redirection (status code 3xx), it follows the redirection and repeats the request. For successful responses (status code 2xx), it parses the body for image URLs and processes them similarly. It prints the status of each URL and handles potential errors gracefully. The monitoring process is repeated in a loop with a delay, specified in seconds, between checks. The URLs to monitor are read from a file provided as a command-line argument.
